              <h1><span class="text-primary">About Me!</span></h1>
              <p class="lead my-4 text-secondary"> Hello there! I'm <b>Fredy Rodriguez de los Santos</b> from Peru-Lima. I'm already 28 years old and
                graduated at <b>PUCP</b> with a bachelor degree in <i>Civil Engineering</i> where i learn and made tons of good friends and a lot of good memories. I have about 5 years of experience about
                building multi-family buildings with a range of budget USD 8-12M. In this past 5 years I have learn how to work with different people in dinstinct fields, being supervised, being chief of older people and I noticed how everybody is an important part of the whole project in order to make it succeed, that in the end we all pull the same boat.<br><br>
                Well when I was on the first semester of college I took a class where they teach us the roots about programing with <b>VBA-Excel</b> and I knew at that moment that logic and understanding was key to solve common and complicated problems and I got seducted by it because sometimes you can get frustrated by not know how to solve something by one way but you have to see the problem from another angle and it was so logic, so simple, I was not the best, but
                I like it a lot and became an enthusiast and now I'm trying to make it as a career, starting with the <b>CS50</b> curse wich have being an amazing experience so
                far and has shown to me, that I can make it with effort and perseverance. <br><br>
                Also I'm on my free times i play a lot in the computer with online and close friends games likes CS:GO, Rocket League, Dota 2, WoW and OverWatch.
                I think being a gamer has taught me helpful tools and skills about working for objetive in common, and Also the importance of comunication to achieve the same goal.
